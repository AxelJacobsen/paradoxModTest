# Completely scripted peace treaties are made here

# THIS is the Taker and FROM the Giver in all scopes unless otherwise stated

# This functionality was made to fully support modded subject types. It can probably also be used for other things, but has the following limitations: 
# These treaties don't support having a different Taker/Giver than the two countries that are negotiating.
# Nor do they support setting provinces (like cede province) or third party countries (like annull treaties) as targets.

# Example:
po_break_bones = {
    name = "Break their bones"
    ai_will_do = {
        factor = 1
    }
    peace_cost = 80
    requires_is_allowed = yes

    effect = {

	hidden_effect = {
		country_event = {
			id = my_mod_bones_of_our_enemies.1
		}
	}
	FROM = {
		hidden_effect = {
			country_event = {
				id = my_mod_broken_bones.1
			}
		}
	}
    }
}
